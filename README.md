## Usage
This project is currently WIP and so unable to be used -- check back soon for that to change though!
That being said, a [nix flake](flake.nix) is included in the repo which will furnish a `dev-shell` -- in response to running `nix develop` ( given you have [Nix](https://nixos.org/) w/ [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) enabled ) -- with the necessary packages for running / interacting with the project locally in its current state.
